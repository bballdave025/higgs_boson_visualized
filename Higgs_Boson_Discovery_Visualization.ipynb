Let's just say it lets us get away with writing equations and measurements without including the defining constants, which include $c$. If you want to know more, you can also look up [nondimensionalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20230316040337/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondimensionalization))); I'm guessing you probably _don't_ want to know more, or even as much as I've said.<br/>\n",

After spending a lot of time trying to estimate them by pure combinatorial calculations, I wondered whether a more practical method than \"abstract thinking\" might not be to lay it out say one hundred times and simply observe and count the number of successful plays. This was already possible to envisage with the beginning of the new era of fast computers, and I immediately thought of problems of neutron diffusion and other questions of mathematical physics, and more generally how to change processes described by certain differential equations into an equivalent form interpretable as a succession of random operations. Later \\[in 1946\\], I described the idea to John von Neumann, and we began to plan actual calculations.\n",
